# Bookstore Application

During practical project we need to build some sort of bookstore app.

Sample functionality:
- Menu;
- Add/Remove book;
- Viewing a book;
- Get information;
- Find books;
- Information about authors(optional);

# How to build it?
- Need to create tasks for each person(trello, drive, excel);
- Share git repository;
- Data structure: Book (isbn, title, author, pages, year, publisher);
-
